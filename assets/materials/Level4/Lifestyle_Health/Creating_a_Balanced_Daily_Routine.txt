Title: Creating a Balanced Daily Routine
WordCount: 121

Script:
My life used to feel very rushed and stressful. I worked long hours, skipped meals, and stayed up late every night. One day, I decided to make a change. I now wake up early, eat breakfast, and take a short walk before starting work. During the day, I set timers to remind myself to stretch and drink water. At night, I stop using screens after 9 p.m. and read a book instead. These small steps help me feel calm and healthy. It's not easy every day, but I try to keep the routine. A balanced life takes effort, but itâ€™s worth it.
