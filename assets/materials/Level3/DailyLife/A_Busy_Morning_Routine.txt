Title: A Busy Morning Routine
WordCount: 99

Script:
Every weekday, I wake up at 6:30 a.m. and start my morning routine. First, I take a quick shower to feel refreshed. Then, I prepare breakfast, usually toast and eggs, and enjoy a cup of coffee. After eating, I brush my teeth and get dressed for work. I check the news on my phone while waiting for the train. Sometimes, the train is delayed, so I leave home early to avoid being late. Mornings can be hectic, but having a routine helps me stay organized and ready for the day.
