Title: Balancing Work and Personal Life
WordCount: 151

Script:
Over the past few months, I've realized how important it is to maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life. When I first started my job, I used to work late every night, thinking it would help me succeed faster. But I soon found myself feeling tired, unmotivated, and disconnected from my friends and family. One day, I decided to make a change. I began setting boundaries—turning off my work phone after 7 p.m. and dedicating time each weekend to hobbies I enjoy, like reading and hiking. Not only did my mood improve, but I also became more productive during working hours. I’ve learned that success isn't just about how many hours you put in at the office—it's also about how well you take care of yourself. In the end, striking that balance leads to a happier and more sustainable lifestyle, both professionally and personally.
