Tomorrow, I have an important job interview.I’ve spent the last few days researching the company and reviewing common interview questions.I practiced answering them in front of the mirror.I also updated my resume and printed extra copies.I chose a clean, professional outfit to wear.I want to make a good first impression.Before going to bed, I packed my bag with everything I need.I’m a little nervous, but I believe I’m ready.This job is a great opportunity, and I want to show them my skills and enthusiasm.
