Script:
Helen Keller was a girl who could not see or hear. When she was very young, she got sick and lost both senses. Her world was silent and dark. But with the help of her teacher, Anne Sullivan, she learned to communicate. At first, it was very hard. Anne used hand signs to spell words. One day, Helen understood that the word "water" meant the cool liquid on her hand. That moment changed her life. She started to learn more and more. Later, Helen went to college and gave speeches to help others. Her story shows that learning is always possible, even when life is hard. She never gave up.
