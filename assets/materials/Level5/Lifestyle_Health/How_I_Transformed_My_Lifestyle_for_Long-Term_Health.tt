Title: How I Transformed My Lifestyle for Long-Term Health

Script:
A year ago, I realized that I needed to make serious changes to my lifestyle. I was always tired, stressed, and had trouble sleeping. My diet was full of processed foods, and I rarely exercised. At first, I started by cooking at home three times a week. Then I gradually added more vegetables and whole grains to my meals. I also started a simple workout routine—just 15 minutes a day of stretching and walking. Over time, I increased it to 30 minutes and even tried yoga. I stopped using my phone an hour before bed, and my sleep improved. Most importantly, I began tracking my mood and energy levels to stay aware of how I felt. These changes didn’t happen overnight, but little by little, they became part of my life. I’m healthier, happier, and more in control of my habits than ever before. And I’m excited to keep growing from here.
