Title: How I Stay Healthy at Work
WordCount: 71

Script:
I work at a desk all day, so I try to stay healthy with small habits. I drink water instead of sweet drinks and take short walks during breaks. I also bring lunch from home, like rice and vegetables, to avoid fast food. These little choices help me feel better and stay focused. Health is not just about big changesâ€”small ones count too.
