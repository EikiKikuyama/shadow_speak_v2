Title: Going to the Supermarket

Script:
On Saturdays, I go to the supermarket near my house. I make a shopping list before I leave. I usually buy vegetables, fruits, eggs, and milk. Sometimes, I get snacks or ice cream as a treat. The store is not too crowded in the morning. After shopping, I walk home with my bags. It's a good way to save money and stay healthy. I enjoy this weekly routine.
