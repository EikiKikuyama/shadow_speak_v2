Title: Handling Unexpected Problems at Work
WordCount: 129

Script:
Today started like any other day, but everything changed when I got to the office. As soon as I sat down, I realized that my computer wasnâ€™t working properly. I tried restarting it several times, but nothing helped. I had an important presentation to finish, so I quickly asked a colleague if I could borrow theirs. Thankfully, they said yes. While I was working, my manager came over and asked for an update. I explained the situation, and she appreciated how I handled the problem. Although it was stressful, I managed to stay calm and finish everything on time. This kind of situation reminds me that unexpected problems will always happen, but the way we respond makes all the difference.
