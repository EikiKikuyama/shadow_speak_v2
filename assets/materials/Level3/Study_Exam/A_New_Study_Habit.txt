Title: A New Study Habit
WordCount: 70

Script:
I used to study only once a week, but I didn’t improve. One day, I changed my routine. I decided to study for 15 minutes every morning. I listen to English on my way to work and write one sentence a day. It’s a small change, but it works. Now, I feel more confident and can understand more.
