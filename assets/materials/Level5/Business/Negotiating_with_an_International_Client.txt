Script:
Last month, I traveled to Singapore to meet with an important client.Our company had been trying to secure a long-term partnership with them.During the meeting, I presented our proposal in detail, highlighting our strengths and explaining how we could support their goals.The client raised concerns about pricing and delivery timelines, so I listened carefully and offered flexible options.I said, "We understand your needs, and weâ€™re open to adjusting the plan to fit your schedule."After a few rounds of discussion, we finally found a solution that worked for both sides.At the end, the client shook my hand and said, "We look forward to working with you."It was a challenging negotiation, but being prepared and respectful helped build trust.This experience taught me that successful business relationships are built on communication, patience, and flexibility.
