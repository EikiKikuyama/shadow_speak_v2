Title: Starting a Simple Morning Stretch
WordCount: 58

Script:
Every morning, I do a short stretch. I raise my arms, touch my toes, and turn my neck slowly. It takes only five minutes. This helps me feel awake and ready for the day. I started this routine last month, and now I feel more active and happy.
