Script:
Soichiro Honda, the visionary founder of Honda Motor Company, never received a formal higher education. Born into a modest family, he dropped out of school at a young age but cultivated a deep passion for engineering. Instead of textbooks, he immersed himself in hands-on experience, often dismantling machines to understand their mechanics. Determined to compete on a global scale, he recognized the importance of learning beyond technical skills. Though not fluent in English, Honda studied foreign manuals meticulously and valued cross-cultural understanding. He surrounded himself with experts and never hesitated to ask questions. His relentless curiosity and willingness to fail set him apart. “Success represents the 1% of your work which results from the 99% that is called failure,” he once remarked. His story exemplifies that true education stems not from institutions but from a relentless drive to grow, explore, and persevere.
